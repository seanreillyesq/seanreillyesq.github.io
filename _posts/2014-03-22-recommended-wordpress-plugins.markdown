WordPress has been one of the most powerful changes to the web since its inception. It offers people the chance to create easy to manage and update websites using only a few clicks.

With extremely professional themes and designs out there for less than £50, people are starting whole web design businesses just using WordPress.

However, what makes it so powerful for people is the plugins. Out there are thousands of downloads which can revolutionise your website and give you incredible features and additions you would need to pay a designer thousands to have on your own site.

Check all of these plugins below to find the best way to give your website all the power and help that it needs.
