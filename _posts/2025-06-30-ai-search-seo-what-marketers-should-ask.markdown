When someone claims, “I searched this in ChatGPT and we didn’t show up,” it’s tempting to shrug it off. But in the messy world of **AI-powered search**, those offhand comments can spark legitimate concerns — and they need a structured response.

## 🔍 Why Asking the Right Questions Matters

AI chat-based tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Copilot are growing fast in visibility. Yet they still make up only around **3% of total web search traffic**. By contrast, **Google accounts for over 90% market share** globally (and around 90% in the UK), with **Bing at just 3–4%**. That means marketing should still prioritise traditional SEO. AI chat tools are interesting and worth watching — but they're nowhere near replacing Google or Bing in terms of volume.

Still — someone asking “why don’t we appear in ChatGPT?” deserves a decent response. The same phrasing or tool can produce very different results depending on a few key variables:

- Prompt wording  
- Follow-up queries  
- Model version and training cut‑off  
- Any stored memory or past chat sessions  
- Plugins, retrieval tools, or browsing enabled  

So instead of guessing, we ask the right questions.

## 🧠 Questions to Ask When Auditing an AI Search Claim

Here's a quick checklist to help surface the right context before we jump to conclusions:

1. **Which AI tool did they use?**  
   ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Harvey... If they mention self‑hosted tools (e.g. Ollama, DeepSeek) or say things like “13b model,” it’s best to pass it to someone technical.

2. **What model version was used?**  
   GPT‑4, GPT‑4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, etc.

3. **What was the initial prompt?**  
   The first thing they typed or said. Get a copy if possible.

4. **Were there follow-up questions?**  
   AI is conversational — one follow-up can change the whole thread.

5. **Was there any stored memory or chat context?**  
   If they’re not sure, they can ask the AI:  
   > *"What context or memory are you using for this answer?"*

6. **Were there any system settings or preferences active?**  
   Things like tone of voice, safe-search filters, or restricted sources.

7. **Was it a fine‑tuned or company-trained model?**  
   If yes — that’s a different game entirely. Flag it to a technical contact.

8. **Can they share the full transcript or a chat link?**  
   Most paid tools (like ChatGPT Plus) allow sharing.

## ⚙️ Model Size ≠ Output Quality

Marketers sometimes hear terms like “7b,” “13b,” or “70b” and assume bigger = better. That’s not quite right.

Those numbers refer to **the number of parameters in a model** — the internal “knobs” it uses to understand language. A 70b model has more of these than a 13b one. But that doesn’t guarantee better answers.

Think of it like engine size: more power doesn't always mean a better ride — it depends on the training, tuning, and context.

## ✅ Why This All Matters

- Google has **begun surfacing Gemini activity in Search Console**, but only for AI Overview impressions — it’s early days, and far from comprehensive.
- There are now a few unofficial tools that let you peek into Gemini or ChatGPT behaviour — but they’re often fragile, manually operated, and not scalable.
- Crucially: **AI models don’t retrieve results like search engines**. They **generate** responses based on data, prompts, and model behaviour — not a ranked list of pages.

## 📌 Bottom Line for Marketers

- **Traditional SEO still matters most** — it powers both human and AI understanding.
- Treat AI visibility checks as **qualitative research**, not a KPI.
- If someone flags something from an AI chat, ask for the right context before jumping in.
- And if they say “7b” like it’s gospel — smile, and tell them to come talk to you.
