Thought I'd share this with everyone just in case there are any nuggets that might be useful for others.

## Tool Blogs

Any of the blogs for the tools that are used can be great, especially Moz and their Whiteboard Friday videos:

- <a href="https://moz.com/blog" target="_blank">Moz Blog</a>

Also the following tools - bearing in mind their content will skew towards using their tools but can be widely applied:

- <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/" target="_blank">SEMrush Blog</a>
- <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ahrefs Blog</a>
- <a href="https://blog.majestic.com/" target="_blank">Majestic Blog</a>

## Official Sources

The Official Google Webmaster Tools Blog is the source for many new updates:

- <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com" target="_blank">Google Webmaster Central Blog</a>

Many official updates, plus things that are being widely noticed by the community but not being talked about officially by the search engines, will come out on these closely related sites:

- <a href="https://searchengineland.com" target="_blank">Search Engine Land</a>
- <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com" target="_blank">SE Roundtable</a>

## Events

If you can make it up to town, Search London is worth attending. They have regular speakers such as Aleyda Solis, Lukas Zelezney, Russell McAthy, etc. as well as the founders/directors of many of the other agencies and toolsets. Good opportunity to network, normally paid ticket but you get a load of content and normally a couple of free drinks:

- <a href="https://www.meetup.com/search-london/" target="_blank">Search London Meetup</a>

Also Brighton SEO - tickets can be sourced for free if you are lucky, as well as paid for with additional benefits such as premium sessions and round tables. If you can't make it, stream the main session live for free:

- <a href="https://www.brightonseo.com" target="_blank">Brighton SEO</a>

Look for the regular authors/speakers on any of the above, especially guest authors, and check out their twitter feeds for content they write or share.

## Courses

If you want to get a wide overview on all digital marketing topics, spend £11 on the following course on Udemy - 19 hour course with video and specific tasks to do:

- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-digital-marketing-course/" target="_blank">Udemy Digital Marketing Course</a>

That should get you started. I haven't touched outreach, social or local there (saying that Greg Gifford is good for local SEO albeit with a US skew - definitely watch his content, it's brilliant).

## Broader Marketing

Finally, look to the wider marketing field as well, especially as digital marketing becomes more just marketing. Marketing Week is good in this respect and especially the content from Mark Ritson who is a very straight shooter (plus adjunct professor of marketing for Sydney University and marketing advisor for LVMH) - he is not a social media marketing fan though!
