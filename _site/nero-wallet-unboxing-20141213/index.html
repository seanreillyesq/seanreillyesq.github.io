				<p>My new Nero Wallets just arrived and I wanted to share some photos, this is not a feature breakdown nor a full review but I plan to do that later after I have used and abused the wallets a little.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-1.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 1" /></p>

<p>I was looking for a new RFID blocking wallet as was concerned about the security of my payment cards, but also wanted a wallet with RFID pass through as I soon to start commuting and wanted to keep my Oyster card accessible.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-2.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 2" /></p>

<p>After looking in a few places online I wasn’t over enamoured by most of the wallets within my budget, so I decided to look on Kickstarter</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-3.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 3" /></p>

<p>After searching for quite a while I found two wallets that I liked. One was the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/432780912/decadent-minimalist-one-aluminum-wallet">DM1: Decedent Minimalist 1 </a> and the other was the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1838971039/nero-rfid-blocking-leather-wallet-40-years-guarant">Nero Wallet</a>. Ultimately I decided to go with the Nero Wallet as the DM1, although beautiful was a bit of a departure from any wallet I had in the past, them all being leather since the age of about 16.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-4.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 4" /></p>

<p>So I decided yes I’d get the Nero Wallet, but this being my first real foray on to Kickstarter I hadn’t noticed that the funding date had been reached! Fortunately for them so had the amount so the project was a go and I thought oh well you win some you lose some. A couple of days later, when I was up in <a href="http://centralworking.com/shoreditch">Central Working in Shoreditch</a> when talk of the lack of security of RFID came up again and I told the people I was talking with about this awesome wallet I found on Kickstarter; whilst searching for the project via Google I found that <a href="http://nerowallet.com/">nerowallet.com</a> had been launched and immediately bought the <a href="http://nerowallet.com/collections/leather/products/leather-wallet">black leather wallet</a> with 4 RFID protected pockets and one pass through that I had decided on.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-5.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 5" /></p>

<p>A day later I received an email from Andra at Nero Wallet’s telling me that I was their very first customer via there online shop and as such the would offer me a free gift of any another wallet at the same price. After a little negotiation (and a bit more money sent their way) I ordered one of their <a href="http://nerowallet.com/collections/carbon-fiber/products/nero-black-carbon-fiber">black carbon fibre wallets</a> as well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-6.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 6" /></p>

<p>Throughout the process of buying the wallets through to delivery I must say I have been very happy with the level of communication from Nero Wallets; they explained that this was a new product and when I could expect to take delivery, and communicated again when it was shipped (which took 6 days). The wallets were packaged minimally, but well presented with Nero Wallet business cards in all the pockets with a printed note on the card in the pocket that has RFID pass through. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-7.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 7" /></p>

<p>So far I am very impressed with the leather wallet, with it easily fitting the 16 plastic cards, 8 or so cardboard reward cards and my notes in something that full is smaller than my now empty old wallet. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-8.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 8" /></p>

<p>The only thing I have seen so far which could be improved upon is that with the wallet empty of the business cards it came with it is not 100% clear which is the RFID passthrough if you drop it in the process of filling it. I am taking a guess that it is the pocket that feels a little less stiff (Andra if you read this please confirm) and will know for sure as soon as I try to use my Oyster card next week!</p>

<p>Edit: Once again proving their commitment to customer service about an hour after posting this Andra &amp; Leo emailed me the following “Since your wallets were the first ones sent (the very first package we made) and we were so excited, I believe we missed placing inside the box the RFID pockets explanatory note. For this we apologize.<br />
The NO RFID protection pocket is situated on the outer side above the inside pocket with the NERO Wallet emblem.”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/nero-wallet-unboxing/nero-wallet-9.jpg" alt="Nero Wallet Unboxing - Picture 9" /></p>

<p>As with the purchase of any new product, proof of how good it is will be in the using so I will write a follow up review toward the end of January when I have had a chance to use both the leather and carbon fibre wallets in the real world.</p>

<p>For more details of the wallets check out the <a href="http://nerowallet.com/">Nero Wallets</a> website and their finished <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1838971039/nero-rfid-blocking-leather-wallet-10-years-guarant">Kickstarter</a> campaign.</p>
