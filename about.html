<p>I'm a <strong>digital marketing leader, entrepreneur, and investor</strong> based in the UK. I've spent over 15 years building and scaling digital businesses across luxury hospitality, luxury goods, ecommerce, and SaaS.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm <strong>Head of Digital Marketing at <a href="https://www.handpickedhotels.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hand Picked Hotels</a></strong>, a £100m luxury hotel group. I lead digital strategy across performance marketing, CRM and loyalty, web development, and analytics.</p>

<p>Alongside that, I run several ventures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.canmarket.co.uk" target="_blank">CanMarket</a></strong> - my marketing consultancy, delivering integrated campaigns and project management for clients ranging from luxury brands to global corporations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.canhost.co.uk" target="_blank">CanHost</a></strong> - high-performance web hosting for small businesses and specialist sites.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://emailmarketingtools.io" target="_blank">Email Marketing Tools</a></strong> - SaaS tools I co-founded, including <a href="https://emailheatmaps.com" target="_blank">Email Heatmaps</a> and <a href="https://linkshortener.io" target="_blank">Link Shortener</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.runandrace.com" target="_blank">Run and Race</a></strong> - a running coaching business I co-direct.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.caninvest.uk" target="_blank">CanInvest</a></strong> - my investment vehicle, building a portfolio of property and stocks focused on generating passive income.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/digibury/" target="_blank">Digibury</a></strong> - a community event series I organise for digital and creative professionals in Canterbury.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before Hand Picked Hotels, I was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head of Ecommerce at Authentic Bespoke</li>
<li>Digital Marketing Manager at <a href="https://www.watchfinder.co.uk/" target="_blank">Watchfinder</a></li>
<li>Head of Marketing at ExtraDigital</li>
<li>Marketing Manager at View City Guides</li>
</ul>

<p>My core expertise is in performance marketing, CRM and loyalty, SEO, paid media, web analytics, and martech architecture. I'm particularly interested in building scalable, cash-generative businesses.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm a husband, father of two, and local Scout leader. I spend my spare time on strength training, aviation and flight simulation, sailing, and tinkering with digital privacy and cybersecurity.</p>
