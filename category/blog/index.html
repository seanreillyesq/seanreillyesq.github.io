				    <p>My new Nero Wallets just arrived and I wanted to share some photos, this is not a feature breakdown nor a full review but I plan to do that later after I have used and abused the wallets a little.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4831.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4831.jpg" alt="IMG_4831.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>I was looking for a new RFID blocking wallet as was concerned about the security of my payment cards, but also wanted a wallet with RFID pass through as I soon to start commuting and wanted to keep my Oyster card accessible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4832.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4832.jpg" alt="IMG_4832.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>After looking in a few places online I wasn&#8217;t over enamoured by most of the wallets within my budget, so I decided to look on Kickstarter</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4834.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4834.jpg" alt="IMG_4834.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>After searching for quite a while I found two wallets that I liked. One was the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/432780912/decadent-minimalist-one-aluminum-wallet">DM1: Decedent Minimalist 1 </a> and the other was the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1838971039/nero-rfid-blocking-leather-wallet-10-years-guarant">Nero Wallet</a>. Ultimately I decided to go with the Nero Wallet as the DM1, although beautiful was a bit of a departure from any wallet I had in the past, them all being leather since the age of about 16.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4833.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4833.jpg" alt="IMG_4833.JPG" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>So I decided yes I&#8217;d get the Nero Wallet, but this being my first real foray on to Kickstarter I hadn&#8217;t noticed that the funding date had been reached! Fortunately for them so had the amount so the project was a go and I thought oh well you win some you lose some. A couple of days later, when I was up in <a href="http://centralworking.com/shoreditch">Central Working in Shoreditch</a> when talk of the lack of security of RFID came up again and I told the people I was talking with about this awesome wallet I found on Kickstarter; whilst searching for the project via Google I found that <a href="http://nerowallet.com/">nerowallet.com</a> had been launched and immediately bought the <a title="RFID Protected Wallet" href="http://nerowallet.com/collections/leather/products/leather-wallet">black leather wallet</a> with 4 RFID protected pockets and one pass through that I had decided on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4836.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4836.jpg" alt="IMG_4836.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>A day later I received an email from Andra at Nero Wallet&#8217;s telling me that I was their very first customer via there online shop and as such the would offer me a free gift of any another wallet at the same price. After a little negotiation (and a bit more money sent their way) I ordered one of their <a href="http://nerowallet.com/collections/carbon-fiber/products/nero-black-carbon-fiber">black carbon fibre wallets</a> as well.<a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4838.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4838.jpg" alt="IMG_4838.JPG" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Throughout the process of buying the wallets through to delivery I must say I have been very happy with the level of communication from Nero Wallets; they explained that this was a new product and when I could expect to take delivery, and communicated again when it was shipped (which took 6 days). The wallets were packaged minimally, but well presented with Nero Wallet business cards in all the pockets with a printed note on the card in the pocket that has RFID pass through. <a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4837.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4837.jpg" alt="IMG_4837.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>So far I am very impressed with the leather wallet, with it easily fitting the 16 plastic cards, 8 or so cardboard reward cards and my notes in something that full is smaller than my now empty old wallet. <a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4835.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4835.jpg" alt="IMG_4835.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>The only thing I have seen so far which could be improved upon is that with the wallet empty of the business cards it came with it is not 100% clear which is the RFID passthrough if you drop it in the process of filling it. I am taking a guess that it is the pocket that feels a little less stiff (Andra if you read this please confirm) and will know for sure as soon as I try to use my Oyster card next week!</p>
<p>Edit: Once again proving their commitment to customer service about an hour after posting this Andra &#038; Leo emailed me the following &#8220;Since your wallets were the first ones sent (the very first package we made) and we were so excited, I believe we missed placing inside the box the RFID pockets explanatory note. For this we apologize.<br />
The NO RFID protection pocket is situated on the outer side above the inside pocket with the NERO Wallet emblem.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4839.jpg"><img class="size-full alignnone" src="http://www.sreilly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4839.jpg" alt="IMG_4839.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>As with the purchase of any new product, proof of how good it is will be in the using so I will write a follow up review toward the end of January when I have had a chance to use both the leather and carbon fibre wallets in the real world.</p>
<p>For more details of the wallets check out the <a title="Nero Wallets" href="http://nerowallet.com/">Nero Wallets</a> website and their finished <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1838971039/nero-rfid-blocking-leather-wallet-10-years-guarant">Kickstarter</a> campaign.</p>

				    <p>WordPress has been one of the most powerful changes to the online landscape since inception. It offers people the chance to create easy to manage and update websites using only a few clicks.</p>
<p>With extremely professional themes and designs out there for less than £50, people are starting whole web design businesses just using WordPress.</p>
<p>However, what makes it so powerful for people is the plug-ins. Out there are thousands of downloads which can revolutionize your website and give you incredible features and additions you need to pay a designer thousands to have on your own site.</p>
<p>Check all of these plug-ins below to find the best way to give your website all the power and help that it needs;</p>
<p><a title="Yoast" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">Yoast</a><br />
Yoast offers you a simple SEO management tool. It allows you to optimize and analyse your web content, and generate XML sitemaps which the search engines absolutely love when it comes to ranking your site. This gives you all the protection and assistance that your site needs so you know if you have designed the site properly, and generated the content in the right manner. Well worth having on your side if you want to do some basic on-site SEO.</p>
<p><a title="W3 Total Cache" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" target="_blank">W3 Total Cache</a><br />
This is the only plug-in of its kind out there on the market. it offers a WordPress Performance Optimization plan which effectively makes your website faster, stronger and better than it was before. It works with just about any web host and will automatically burrow in and do all of the most important aspects your website needs to run at its very best. A must have.</p>
<p><a title="Google XML Sitemaps" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/" target="_blank">Google XML Sitemaps</a><br />
A sitemap is a great way to give the search engines a helping hand. It lets them settle in easily to the system and create fully fledged and easy to manage codes that allow the search engines to index your website efficiently and in the right order. A must for any SEO do-gooder out there, as it gives you the access you are going to need to the “good side” of the search engines.</p>
<p><a title="WP-Optimize" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/" target="_blank">WP-Optimize</a><br />
This effectively cleans up the database and the background info of your WordPress site. If you constantly make changes or try things you aren’t quite sure of this can be a good way to get things running properly again. It even works without phpMyAdmin, which is a life saver as that place can be a mine-field for those without extensive WP experience. This is a great mod, and one of the few like it out there.</p>
<p><a title="WP Clean Up" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-clean-up/" target="_blank">WP Clean Up</a><br />
Like Optimize above, it hunts down things you don’t want interfering with your site and its progress. It removes things like revisions and drafts from the system, helping clear up valuable system space and giving your project the protection and pace it needs. A slow website will not get visitors and this plug-in can help get rid of all the “gunk” within your database and make your site run faster than it has before.</p>
<p><a title="WP Smush It" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank">WP Smush It</a><br />
This simply plug-in offers a brilliant way to optimize the images on your website. It can convert images to the right file type for easy loading and sharing, optimizes compressing of all images across the website so they look the best they can while taking up less data, and it removes all indexed images which are un-used. This is a powerful tool that can give you a much quicker way to making your website quicker to load and more enjoyable to use. A must have.</p>
<p><a title="Gravity FOrms" href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a><br />
Gravity Forms are easy to customize and include contact forms for your website. Whether you want to sell products, set up enquiry lines, or just want a cool section added to your website, this is a necessity. This is simple to set up and looks good with just about any theme, well worth your time and your effort.</p>
<p><a title="Head Cleaner" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/head-cleaner/" target="_blank">Head Cleaner</a><br />
This great little tool is working all in the name of making your website quicker than it was before. It cleans up tags and removes unneeded extras from your header and your footer. This will help your website load faster as it will be able to load your style sheets and the like much quicker than it used to. Well worth installing – it only takes a few seconds.</p>
<p><a title="Hotfix" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hotfix/" target="_blank">Hotfix</a><br />
Hotfix is an unofficial WP “patch” that fixes common errors and problems that others are sick of waiting for WP to sort themselves. This means you can get a nice little solution to some of those silly problems that occur for no reason at all, taking the stress from yourself and letting you concentrate on building a good website!</p>
<p><a title="Jetpack" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a><br />
Powering up your website with the strength of the WordPress cloud, you can find out amazing stats and info about how your website is performing. It also allows you to set up several other features like social networking and comment systems, contact forms included and easily embedding media files from websites like YouTube with just a few clicks. More than worth having alongside your other plug-ins as it can make your site much more powerful overall.</p>
<p><a title="Link Library" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/link-library/" target="_blank">Link Library</a><br />
This will help keep track of all the links on your website, allowing you to easily see where things are going from one end to the other. You can even search through the list to see what you are up against and what you need to improve upon on our site. Nice and simple but extremely effective and can give your site the edge it needs.</p>
<p><a title="NextGEN Gallery" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" target="_blank">NextGEN Gallery</a><br />
A simple photo gallery plug-in that gives your site a much needed photographic boost. Easy to use and implement slideshows etc. you can create quick and easy gallery pages for your own websites or your clients using this awesome tool.</p>
<p><a title="Wordpress Importer " href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/" target="_blank">WordPress Importer</a><br />
This lets you bring in settings and features with ease. If you are using a WP theme it may come with a document which can be used with the Importer, which will then set up the website for you and leave you with a simple to manage website that is already set up for you. an extremely useful plug-in for optimizing a theme or downloaded design.</p>
<p><a title="WP Google Analytics" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-analytics/" target="_blank">WP Google Analytics</a><br />
Lets you easily track the analytics and design of your site, allowing you to find out useful data like how fast your site is, how many links are coming to your site, as well as a custom check on each page to find out everything from how many visited to how long they stayed for. this type of data can be invaluable to the overall mastering and running of your website.</p>
<p><a title="WP Total Hacks" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-total-hacks/" target="_blank">WP Total Hacks</a><br />
WP Total Hacks gives you access to basically anything you can think of within the WP site or the control panel itself. From the favicon to the logo at the top of the login page, you can completely alter this to make the login page of your WP site look like something far more professional and unique. An excellent way to continue to build your sites brand and improve its image for the future.</p>

				    <p>1. Start with changing your password on your account. As with any scenario, the primary step is to stop any harm. This will resolve most issues, depending on how your account was compromised.</p>
<p>2. Add a fake email address to your list of contacts: 1111@aaaaa.co.uk. This email address will probably be the first contact alphabetically in your address book, therefore will become the primary recipient of a spam email from a hacker. You will receive a mail failure notice as soon as any e-mail to this address isn&#8217;t delivered. This is often also a fast means of checking whether or not ever-changing your password on your email account worked.</p>
<p>3. Update and run your antivirus program on your PC such as <a title="AVG" href="http://free.avg.com/">AVG</a>, <a title="kaspersky" href="http://www.kaspersky.co.uk/">Kaspersky</a>, Norton, etc. (I do not recommend McAfee due to past experience) to make sure your PC isn’t infected.</p>
<p>4. Write to everybody in your contact list and make them aware that your email was hacked and warn them to not click on the link of the previous email:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to send email your contacts by using the BCC line of your email so you&#8217;re not sending out people’s non-public email addresses to others. (Put your email address within the To line.)</li>
<li>Only send your message to 10 contacts at a time, so your warning email doesn’t find yourself in their Spam folders.</li>

				    <p>On a recent family holiday to Benalmádena I had the opportunity to have a quick run up Mount Calamorro, part of the coastal Sierra de Mijas mountain range in the Costa Del Sol region of southern Spain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At only 771 metres high, it was far lower that most of the Tour du Mont Blanc that I tackled last year, however it was a pleasant surprise to have the chance to go up as I was only expecting to have a simple “bucket and spade” holiday with my lovely wife and kids; fortunately I had packed my running shoes!</p>

<p>The trail map to Mount Calamorro, Cerro del Morro and a few other treks in the municipality can be seen on a board just by the start of the cable car, <a href="http://www.telefericobenalmadena.com/" rel="nofollow">Teleférico Benalmádena</a>, which is where I left my the family and set off.</p>
<p>After deciding to do Route One direct to Calamorro, I initially found two slightly baffling things. First that Route One was actually two trails to different destinations and second that it was a couple unmarked kilometres through the streets on Benalmádena to the trail head; fortunately I had my <a title="Apple Iphone Deals on 3" href="http://www.dealson3.co.uk/manufacturer/apple/">iPhone</a> with me.</p>
<p><a title="Start of Route One Calamorro and Emita" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-76mh8vq7-0Q/TetGj2pOeqI/AAAAAAAAAUU/28h_jH-GZ10/IMG_0427.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter" title="Start of Route One Calamorro and Emita" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-76mh8vq7-0Q/TetGj2pOeqI/AAAAAAAAAUU/28h_jH-GZ10/h350/IMG_0427.jpg" alt="IMG_0427.jpg" width="350" /></a></p>
<p>I finally made it to the official start of the trail just under the E-15 motorway, about one mile by my Garmin, which luckily is marked with a big wooden route board, however the board adds further confusion by not mentioning the Calamorro at all. It only mentions the other destination that Route One takes you to, Ermita.</p>
<p>However I had noticed the both trails went passed the cemetery which was sign posted further up the trail. I ran the half mile or so up the road, past the cemetery and local tip (!) to the junction of a very new neighbourhood that looked only recently built with very low occupancy.</p>
<p>This is where the fun began. At the junction were two signs, the first I came to was a route map exactly like that near the Benalmádena cable car and on a reasonably well made, but clearly small, tarmac road. The second was another reddish wooden route board, proudly proclaiming that Route One was straight up the hill on its suburban street.</p>
<p>What should I do? My heart said to follow the small road surely this must be the access road mentioned on the map. My head said but surely they would mark this as the split in the paths and proclaim that this was the path to Monte Calamorro? Wouldn’t that make sense? Basically I forgot what country I was in… and followed the Route board. Mistake 1.</p>
<p><a title="Calamorro, which way?" href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IqS-QKVwUOM/TetHBDlGcWI/AAAAAAAAAUc/tvjy0iTk9tM/IMG_0429.JPG" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter" title="Calamorro, which way?" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IqS-QKVwUOM/TetHBDlGcWI/AAAAAAAAAUc/tvjy0iTk9tM/h350/IMG_0429.JPG" alt="IMG_0429.JPG" width="350" /></a></p>
<p>Following up the residential street I came about a third of a mile I came to another trail map, turned right up a dusty track and felt vindicated, yes my head was right. A few minutes on I came to another reddish wooden route sign. But wait this one was broken and what was left of it was clearly pointing me to go through a track blocked with barbed wire. Hmmm. Maybe its round the back of this big white building I thought and thus began a 10 minute waste of time rounding the building and walking through the scrub to no avail. Mistake 2.</p>
<p>I eventually got back to the last route marker, realising why some fellow wanderer had attempted to dismantle it, then went back to the last trail map and turned right down the hill to find another way up. Final mistake.</p>
<p>After about a mile and another wasted ten minutes I returned to the junction to find a runner coming down the access road and after a quick nod to my “top of Calamorro” question I was back on route, 30 minutes behind and about 2 miles of extra road under my feet, but back on route!</p>
<p><a title="Calamorro Route One Path" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-nL4NrmIL284/TetHpO8AdKI/AAAAAAAAAUo/_7dD2F9C0L4/IMG_0431.JPG" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter" title="Calamorro Route One Path" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-nL4NrmIL284/TetHpO8AdKI/AAAAAAAAAUo/_7dD2F9C0L4/h350/IMG_0431.JPG" alt="IMG_0431.JPG" width="350" /></a></p>
<p>From here the route was easier to find after nearly a mile of fairly boring, but well tarmaced road I came to a red arrow pointing up a trail and a downhill mountain biker coming hurtling towards me. A little envious of him, I let him continue after he confirmed I was on the right track and I continued up the gorge.</p>
<p>The path was well kept and clear to follow, apart from what looked like a small and relatively recent landslip, which I navigated around. The running was fairly easy but a bit sandy in places and I could feel my shoes filling up.</p>
<p><a title="Looking back down Calamorro Route One and Two." href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ykI18NYGnvE/TetILHznAaI/AAAAAAAAAUw/CPXqIq1we40/IMG_0434.JPG" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter" title="Looking back down Calamorro Route One and Two." src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ykI18NYGnvE/TetILHznAaI/AAAAAAAAAUw/CPXqIq1we40/h350/IMG_0434.JPG" alt="IMG_0434.JPG" width="350" /></a></p>
<p>After another three quarters of a mile I joined up with Route Two, which I remembered from the trail map also continued to summit Mount Calamorro.</p>
<p>Another quarter of a mile and this joined up again with the access road and was tarmac again for the half mile up to the top station of the Teleférico Benalmádena with the summit a short jog up rocky steps with handrails.</p>
<p><a title="Me on the Summit of Calamorro" href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vpXswnYR1pc/TetKdDJAVlI/AAAAAAAAAV0/6kWIBgVZcV8/IMG_0438.JPG" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter" title="Me on the Summit of Calamorro" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vpXswnYR1pc/TetKdDJAVlI/AAAAAAAAAV0/6kWIBgVZcV8/h350/IMG_0438.JPG" alt="IMG_0438.JPG" width="350" /></a></p>
<p>Although a bit annoyed at the unneeded diversion, I was happy have achieved a quick run up a mountain especially on my birthday.</p>
<p>Calamorro is not a massive test or a hugely exciting trail by any stretch of the imagination, but the views along the Costa del Sol from the summit certainly make for it.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to share these views with my wife and our three and five year old in the cable car on the way down; pointing out to them the downhill cyclist coming back up in the Teleférico for another go.</p>
